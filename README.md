# Problem Solving Using C#

## Basic Problem

### Basic Problem 1 
Given three numbers, write a method that adds two first ones and multiplies them by a third one.

### Basic Problem 2
Given a temperature in Celsius degrees, write a method that converts it to Fahrenheit degrees. Remember that temperature below -271.15°C (absolute zero) does not exist!  
Expected input and output  
CtoF(0) → "T = 32F"  
CtoF(100) → "T = 212F"  
CtoF(-300) → "Temperature below absolute zero!"
