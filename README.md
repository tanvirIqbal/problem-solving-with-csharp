### Basic Problem 1 
Given three numbers, write a method that adds two first ones and multiplies them by a third one.

### Basic Problem 2
Given a temperature in Celsius degrees, write a method that converts it to Fahrenheit degrees. Remember that temperature below -271.15°C (absolute zero) does not exist!  
Expected input and output  
CtoF(0) → "T = 32F"  
CtoF(100) → "T = 212F"  
CtoF(-300) → "Temperature below absolute zero!"  

### Basic Problem 3
Given two integers, write a method that returns results of their elementary arithmetic operations: addition, substraction, multiplication, division. Remember that you can't divide any number by 0!  
Expected input and output   
ElementaryOperations(3, 8) → 11, -5, 24, 0.375  

### Basic Problem 4
Given three integers, write a method that returns first number divided modulo by second one and these divided modulo by third one.  
Expected input and output   
ModuloOperations(8, 5, 2) → 1  

### Basic Problem 5
Given a number, write a method that returns its cube.  
Expected input and output  
TheCubeOf(2) → 8  
TheCubeOf(-5.5) → -166.375  

### Basic Problem 6
Given two integers, write a method that swaps them using temporary variable.  
Expected input and output  
SwapTwoNumbers(87, 45) → "Before: a = 87, b = 45; After: a = 45, b = 87"  
SwapTwoNumbers(-13, 2) → "Before: a = -13, b = 2; After: a = 2, b = -13"
